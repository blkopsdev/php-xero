# xero-php sample app

This is a sample app for the xero-php SDK. Currently, this app focuses on demonstrating the functionality of all Accounting API endpoints and their related actions.  

You'll be able to connect to a Xero Organisation and make real API calls. The code used to make each API call will be displayed along with the results returned from Xero's API.

### Xero App
This sample app uses a Xero [Public](http://developer.xero.com/documentation/auth-and-limits/public-applications/) App.

Go to [http://app.xero.com](http://app.xero.com) and login with your Xero user account to create a Xero Public app. You'll set the callback URL and get your consumer key & secret.

### Setup App

Make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed, then create this project using

```bash
composer create-project xero/xero-php-sample-app
``` 

This will download this project and all its dependencies into a folder called `xero-php-sample-app`

### Configure

There is an example config file in `config/xero.example.php`, which contains all required parameters.  Copy this file to `config/xero.php` and insert your consumer key and secret.

```php
	return [
        'oauth' => [
            //This is just for demo purposes, it should be set from a more reliable source for production use
            'callback'        => "http://$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]/application/callback",
    
            'consumer_key'    => 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY',
            'consumer_secret' => 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET',
    
            'signature_location'  => \XeroPHP\Remote\OAuth\Client::SIGN_LOCATION_QUERY,
        ],
        'curl' => [
            CURLOPT_USERAGENT   => 'XeroPHP Sample App',
            CURLOPT_CAINFO => APP_ROOT . '/certs/ca-bundle.crt',
        ],
    ];
```

### Running

The best way to run this project (with the least configuration), is using PHP's development web server.  Change to the webroot and start it on your chosen port

```bash
cd xero-php-sample-app/public
php -S localhost:8999
```

You should not be able to navigate to [http://localhost:8999](http://localhost:8999) and use the application.
